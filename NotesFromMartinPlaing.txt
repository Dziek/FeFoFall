Make Crushers easier - had given up
Make Player Spins easier
Make Options easier / more fun
Make Be Brave text easier
Add LevelFailure text to Marks The Spot and change the text
Boost Round Corners is bad
Both me and Martin kept going at the 'wrong' bit on CornerCamera

???
Make ReversedControls easier? - smaller player?
Lights Out Martin didn't notice EndPoint at all, aiming for top corner
CameraRotates wider than others? I don't think so
Didn't get Sequence straight away, also needs better delay
Make player slower in Timing?
Add delay to start of Virtues?
Add dots in laps to show how many you've done, and a direction bit
Make Minefield easier?
Make SpearFishing player thinner

!!!
Liked CameraRotates
Smiled at Journey
Smiled at various invisible ones
Got a reaction for Be Brave!
Liked Decoys
Went to leave but played a few more levels - good sign

THOUGHTS
Possibly have all player starting points not near a wall in early levels,
so when people get confused they can try and save it?
Change Safe Space name
Martin wasn't as happy with SplitCamera as I am
Martin did not like Marks The Spot
Maybe have an easier invisble EndPoint level to make Marks The Spot better?
Make the other Elevator have an elaboration like Martin thought
I was going to make Mouth more difficult, but Martin struggled
Bait wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, I think having multiple EndPoints
on show diminishes it
Levels Hints like CodeBreaker need to show up more, maybe make new script

BUGS
When pressing escape during Transition it messes up again
